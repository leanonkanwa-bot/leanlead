"""Job tracker, persisted to disk so jobs survive container restarts.

In-memory only would lose every active job each time Railway redeploys.
This stores state at storage/jobs.json (an atomic write per update). On
boot we reload and triage non-terminal jobs:

  ready_for_review  → left unchanged (plan is on disk, no worker running)
  rendering         → if source + plan_data on disk, added to _resumable_jobs
                       for auto-requeue by startup; otherwise marked error
  queued            → if source on disk, added to _resumable_jobs for phase-1
                       requeue; otherwise marked error
  transcribing /
  planning          → marked error (can't resume mid-transcription); user can
                       click Retry which restarts from the stored source file
  anything else     → marked error with re-upload message

Mount a Railway Volume at /app/backend/storage (DATA_DIR=/data) so that
source files and jobs.json outlive container restarts. Without the volume,
source files vanish on every deploy and auto-resume falls back to error.

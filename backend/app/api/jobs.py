"""Job tracker, persisted to disk so jobs survive container restarts.

In-memory only would lose every active job each time Railway redeploys.
This stores state at storage/jobs.json (an atomic write per update). On
boot we reload + mark any non-terminal job as an error so polling clients
see a real message instead of a 404 / a forever-spinner.

NOTE: persistence only saves *state*, not the in-flight background task.
A job that was rendering when the container died cannot resume from where
it left off (the FFmpeg subprocess is gone). The user must re-upload.
For real continuity across deploys, mount a Railway Volume at
/app/backend/storage AND keep deploys clear of in-flight uploads.

"""Rhythm-Aware Silence Remover — Feature 2.

Processes word timestamps and segments to identify pauses and filler words
that should be removed without disrupting natural speech rhythm.

Rules:
  - Remove pauses > 0.5s mid-sentence.
  - Remove pauses > 0.3s after filler words (um, uh, like, basically, etc.).
  - Keep authority pauses before periods/full-stops.
  - Keep emphasis pauses before PRINCIPLE/PAYOFF keywords.
  - Keep question beats (pause before rhetorical questions).
  - Keep last 0.3s of each segment.
  - Remove filler words when they are standalone (not used as comparisons).

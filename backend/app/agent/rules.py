"""

NARRATIVE_STRUCTURE = """\
NARRATIVE STRUCTURE — every video maps onto these ten beats

  1. HOOK (0–3s)
     One sentence. No setup. No intro. No name.
     The viewer must feel something in the first 2 seconds or the video
     is dead. Hormozi rule: start with the conclusion, not the intro.

  2. CONTRAST (3–8s)
     What everyone believes vs what is actually true.
     Make them feel slightly wrong for believing the common thing.

  3. CONSEQUENCE (8–13s)
     What staying wrong costs them. Real. Personal. Visceral.
     Not statistics — lived experience.

  4. LOOP (13–18s)
     Open a question. Do NOT answer it.
     "But the real reason is something nobody explains."
     "And what happens next is what changes everything."
     The viewer cannot leave because they need the answer.

  5. STORY (18–35s)
     One real moment. Specific details. No lessons yet.
     Sanchez rule: make them see the scene like a movie.

  6. REALIZATION (35–42s)
     The turning point. Short. No explanation.
     Drop it like a fact. Let it hit.

  7. PRINCIPLE (42–50s)
     One sentence. Universal. Timeless. Quotable.
     This is the line they screenshot. This is why they follow.

  8. REFRAME (50–55s)
     Completely flip their mental model.
     What looked like a problem is actually the path.

  9. PAYOFF (55–65s)
     The idea they save the video for.
     Practical or deeply emotional. Sometimes both.
     Sanchez rule: give them something usable tomorrow morning.

 10. CLOSING REFLECTION (last 3–5s)
     One sentence. Drop it. Silence.
     Do not explain it. Do not soften it.
     The discomfort of the ending is what makes them comment.
"""

CUT_PHILOSOPHY = """\
CUT PHILOSOPHY — Hormozi / Sanchez surgical removal

Every single filler word is cut, instantly:
   um · uh · like · basically · so · you know · right · donc · euh · bah
   · en fait (when empty) · I mean · just · actually

Every pause above 0.25 seconds is cut EXCEPT:
   - the 0.5s silence BEFORE the PRINCIPLE line (intentional weight),
   - the 0.3s silence BEFORE the CLOSING line (let it land),
   - any pause the creator uses for deliberate emphasis (keep these).

Repetition kills retention. If the creator says the same idea twice,
keep only the strongest take. If they restart a sentence ("the thing
about… the thing is…") cut to the cleaner restart.

Every jump cut must feel intentional, not accidental. With every cut
SOMETHING changes — zoom level, energy, framing, or delivery intensity.

Hormozi rhythm pattern:
   Fast → Fast → Fast → SLOW → Fast → Fast → STOP.
   The SLOW is where the message lands.
   The STOP is where they save the video.
"""

ZOOM_SYSTEM = """\
ZOOM SYSTEM — the tension engine. Three moves, master these three.

ABSOLUTE RULE: NO SHAKE. NO TREMBLE. EVER.
The renderer eases every drift with smoothstep — your job is to make
sure your zoom_plan windows DO NOT OVERLAP and that consecutive
windows share endpoint values (the `to` of window N == the `from` of
window N+1) so the curve is continuous. Anchor is locked to frame
center; you do not control x/y.

SLOW ZOOM IN  (kind: "drift")
  Speed: extremely slow, must be subconscious.
  Rate: +0.5% per second maximum (e.g. 100% → 103% over 6s).
  Use during: Hook, Consequence, Principle, Closing.

SLOW ZOOM OUT  (kind: "pull_out")
  Speed: slow and deliberate.
  Rate: -0.5% per second maximum (e.g. 108% → 102% over 12s).
  Use during: after peak tension, Story, Realization, Reframe.

PUNCH IN  (kind: "punch_in")
  Instant cut held for the whole window.
  Renderer DOES NOT interpolate — it locks at `to` for the whole
  [start, end] window. Make `start` and `end` close (≈0.05s) and
  schedule a slow zoom-in continuation right after.
  Jump: minimum +15% scale.
  Use on: the single most important word per section, supplied as
  `on_word`.
  Never twice within 10 seconds.
  Always followed by a slow drift continuing from the new scale.

Reference arc for short-form (60s):
   0–5s     100% → 103%   slow zoom in
   5–15s    103% → 108%   slow zoom in
  15–25s    108% → 102%   slow zoom OUT (breath after contrast)
  25–35s    102% → 112%   slow zoom in
  35.0–35.05s  PUNCH IN to 122%   (on principle word)
  35.05–45s    122% → 126% slow zoom in
  Final     PUNCH IN to 130% — hold — hard cut

For long-form, the same shapes but with lower amplitude:
  base 100%, drift to 105–110% max, punch-ins reserved for one per chapter.
"""

CAPTION_RULES = """\
CAPTION RULES — non-negotiable. The renderer enforces these mechanically.

Font: Poppins Bold by default. The user may pick any of:
  Poppins Bold / Poppins ExtraBold / Poppins SemiBold /
  Montserrat Bold / Montserrat Black / Inter Bold / Roboto Bold /
  Bebas Neue / DM Sans Bold / Space Grotesk Bold.

Color: ONE single color, no shadow / outline / gradient / stroke.
  - Pure White       #FFFFFF
  - Electric Yellow  #FFE500
  - Clean Red        #FF3B30
  - Electric Blue    #0A84FF
  - Orange Flash     #FF6B00

EMPHASIS-ONLY CAPTIONS — sparse and punchy:
  Captions appear ONLY for words listed in `caption_emphasis_words`.
  Do NOT try to caption every word — the renderer suppresses non-emphasis
  words automatically. Pick 1–3 high-impact words per clip segment, not one
  per sentence. Rarer = more powerful.

SIZE — single consistent size, ~7% of video height.
  The renderer applies this automatically. Do NOT try to specify sizes.
  Just return the emphasis words in `caption_emphasis_words`.

ONE word per caption frame. Maximum. Always.
Words appear ONLY when they are spoken — exactly on the syllable.

No punctuation in captions. Ever. No commas, no periods, no quotes.

Zero captions during B-roll. Pause the caption track over those
windows (the renderer does this automatically from `broll_suggestions`).

Caption styles available to the renderer:
  - "impact" (default)    — one-word card, 2px outline + 2px drop-shadow
                            for readability. Position controlled by user
                            (center / bottom / side-left / side-right).
  - "kinetic"             — one-word card with a dark bar background
                            (#1A1A1A, ~90% opaque), forced to bottom.
"""

HYPERFRAMES = """\
HYPERFRAMES — subliminal pattern interrupts

Every 20–30 seconds, place ONE hyperframe.
A hyperframe is a single full-screen visual that appears for 2–4 frames
only (≈0.08–0.16s at 30fps). Subliminal. The viewer feels it, can't
explain why.

Allowed kinds:
  - "word"   — a single bold word filling the screen (PUSH, NOW, WHY, STOP)
  - "number" — one number filling the screen (3, 47, $1M, 80%)
  - "color"  — a flat solid color flash (uses brand or accent)
  - "image"  — describe the image; renderer renders it as a colored card
               with the description text for v1 — full image B-roll comes
               in v2.

Pick a `color` per hyperframe. Default to brand_color if the user provided
one. Pick contrasting color from the on-screen scene to maximise the
interrupt feel.

Return as `hyperframes`: list of objects with `at`, `duration`,
`kind`, `content`, `color`.

Rules:
  - One hyperframe per 20–30s window. Don't bunch them.
  - Never inside a B-roll window.
  - Hyperframes during silence or right before a punch-in feel best.
"""

MOTION_GRAPHICS = """\
MOTION GRAPHICS — every graphic earns its existence

Decoration is the enemy of retention. If a graphic does not make the
message stronger, it does NOT appear in the output.

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
TIMING — appear AFTER the words are spoken, never before
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Set `at` to 0.5–1.5 s AFTER the relevant sentence or key word
STARTS being spoken — never at or before it.
The viewer must hear the idea first, then see the graphic that
reinforces it. A graphic that pops before the speaker says the word
feels like a spoiler and breaks the rhythm.

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
POSITIONING — never cover the subject's face
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
The user message will contain a "SUBJECT POSITION" block with the
exact y_pct safe zones detected by Claude Vision for THIS video.
Use those coordinates — they override any generic defaults below.

Generic fallbacks (when no vision data is available):
  Portrait 1080 × 1920 → safe: y_pct ≤ 10 or y_pct ≥ 72.
  Landscape 1920 × 1080 → safe: x_pct ≤ 10 or x_pct ≥ 62.
For checklist and stat_circle the renderer anchors them to the
upper zone automatically; you do not need to set y for those.
Full-frame types (quote_card, split_screen, versus, typography_broll,
money_counter) render at x=0, y=0 and fill the frame — use sparingly
so they don't cover the speaker for too long.

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
text_overlay — the universal primitive
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Place arbitrary text anywhere on the frame, with the font, size,
colour, position, line-wrap, and slide direction you choose.

Schema:
  { at, duration, kind: "text_overlay",
    text: "Dev Team\\n+ Maintenance\\n= Drag",
    font: "Poppins Bold" | "Bebas Neue" | …      // any allowed font
    size: 15,                                     // % of frame short edge
    color: "#FFFFFF",                             // any hex
    align: "left" | "center" | "right",
    x_pct: 5, y_pct: 8,                          // % of frame WxH
    max_width_pct: 25,                            // soft-wrap at 25% frame width
    slide_in: "left" | "right" | "none" }

`size` is a PERCENTAGE of the frame's shorter dimension (1080 on both
short and long form). size: 15 → 162 px — readable but not overwhelming.
Use `\\n` to break lines manually; use `max_width_pct` for soft wrap.
Keep x_pct ≤ 10 or ≥ 62 and y_pct ≤ 12 or ≥ 72 to stay off the face.

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
templates — for common shapes
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  - "lower_third" — section title sliding in from the left.
      { at, duration: 2, kind: "lower_third",
        title: "Building Your", accent_word: "Content Machine" }
      use: every section transition.

  - "stat_circle" — donut chart with a big percent in the centre.
      { at, duration: 2.5, kind: "stat_circle",
        to: 80, label: "of your time" }
      use: every time a percentage or stat is spoken.

  - "checklist" — stacked rounded pill buttons with red ✗ or green ✓.
      { at, duration: 3, kind: "checklist",
        items: [{text: "Not a Demo", ok: false},
                {text: "Real Automations", ok: true}] }
      use: contrasting wrong vs right. ≤ 5 words each, ≤ 4 items.

  - "quote_card" — full-frame inspirational quote block.
      { at, duration: 3.5, kind: "quote_card",
        text: "The quote text here", speaker: "— Person Name" }
      use: principle moments, scripture, memorable one-liners.

  - "split_screen" — left/right comparison panel.
      { at, duration: 3, kind: "split_screen",
        left: "Old way", right: "New way",
        left_label: "WRONG", right_label: "RIGHT" }
      use: before/after, wrong/right, old/new contrasts.

  - "timeline" — horizontal timeline with labeled events.
      { at, duration: 4, kind: "timeline",
        events: [{label: "Started", year: "2019"}, {label: "Pivoted", year: "2021"}] }
      use: journey, history, step progression.

  - "versus" — two-card head-to-head comparison.
      { at, duration: 3, kind: "versus",
        left: "Employee", right: "Entrepreneur", winner: "right" }
      use: direct comparisons, options, choices.

  - "notification" — iPhone-style banner overlay.
      { at, duration: 2.5, kind: "notification",
        title: "New message", body: "You have 3 unread", app_name: "Messages" }
      use: social proof moments, DM reveals, alert-style data.

  - "typography_broll" — full-frame bold word with supporting context.
      { at, duration: 2, kind: "typography_broll",
        text: "FREEDOM", words: ["time", "location", "money"] }
      use: power words, principles, emotional peaks.

  - "money_counter" — large formatted dollar/number display.
      { at, duration: 2, kind: "money_counter",
        to: 1250000, currency: "$", positive: true }
      use: revenue, costs, big numbers the speaker is referencing.

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
TRIGGER WORDS → GRAPHIC RESPONSE
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
When the speaker mentions these, use this graphic type:

"percent / %" → stat_circle (count_up)
"number / amount / cost / price / $" → money_counter
"first / second / third / step" → timeline or checklist
"wrong / mistake / most people think" → split_screen (left_label: "WRONG") or checklist with red X items
"right / solution / instead" → split_screen (right_label: "RIGHT") or checklist with green items
"versus / vs / compare" → versus or split_screen
"God / faith / Bible / prayer / church" → quote_card with the spiritual line
"listen / remember / key insight" → typography_broll with the key word
Use checklist for lists of 3–5 items
Use lower_third for section titles and transitions
Use text_overlay for quick data points that reinforce what is being said

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
pacing
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
3–8 graphics in a 60s short, 10–18 in a 5–8 min long. Don't stack
two graphics in the same 4s window — let each breathe. Mix
text_overlay (light, frequent) with templates (heavier, rarer
landings) so the screen never feels static or cluttered.

Return all of them as `motion_graphics`: list of objects with `at`,
`duration`, `kind`, plus the kind-specific fields above.
"""

BROLL_RULES = """\
B-ROLL — maximum 3 clips, ever.

Placement (must match the spoken context — never random):
  Clip 1 → during CONTRAST   (show the wrong way visually)
  Clip 2 → during STORY      (one concrete scene from the moment)
  Clip 3 → during PAYOFF     (make the idea land visually)

Each b-roll suggestion's `at` is the EXACT START of the sentence whose
content the visual matches. Read the transcript word-by-word and pick
b-roll moments that align with the spoken concept — not random
intervals.

DURATION: minimum 2.5s, maximum 4.0s. Hard cuts in, hard cuts out.
The renderer will clamp anything outside that range — but if you
emit 0.1s b-rolls the renderer will pull them up to 2.5s and they
may overshoot a section. Pick the right window the first time.

No transitions. No fades. No dissolves. Captions are paused during
b-roll automatically.

If b-roll does not make the message stronger, it does not exist.
If you cannot find a sentence whose context matches a b-roll concept,
DO NOT EMIT THAT B-ROLL. Better zero clips than mismatched ones.

RETENTION_MECHANICS = """\
HIGH-RETENTION MECHANICS

Re-hook every 30 seconds — a new tension, a new promise, or a pattern

The whole video is a chain of unanswered questions until the payoff.

Silence as a weapon: 0.5s of silence > 5s of talking, when placed

Energy modulation: fast delivery raises energy; slower delivery
increases weight. The contrast is what makes the slow moments
unforgettable.

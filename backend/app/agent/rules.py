                        its place. Silence as punctuation.
  - Ali Abdaal        — warm authority, curiosity-driven hooks, ideas backed by

  - Iman Gadzhi       — direct, aspirational, zero filler. Hook with outcome,

  - Alex Hormozi      — pattern interrupts, bold reframes, surgical filler removal.
  - MrBeast           — re-hook every 30s, open loops, relentless forward momentum.

TRANSCRIPT_INTEGRITY = """\
TRANSCRIPT INTEGRITY — ABSOLUTE RULE #1

You ONLY use words that exist verbatim in the transcript.
Zero paraphrase. Zero new words. Zero invented phrases.
You CUT, REORDER, and RESURFACE — nothing else.

MULTILINGUAL — match the video's language exactly.
The transcript may be French, English, Spanish, Arabic, Portuguese,
or any other language. The LANGUAGE field in the user message tells
you what was detected. ALL output fields that contain spoken words
(script_structure lines, caption_emphasis_words, key_lines) MUST be
in the SAME language as the transcript. titres_ctr and thumbnail_mot
are also in the video's language. Never translate the speaker's words.

FILLER WORD REMOVAL — do this BEFORE building any edit plan.
Scan the full transcript and mark these for immediate removal:
  um · uh · like · basically · so · you know · right · I mean · just
  actually · literally · obviously · honestly · kind of · sort of
  donc · euh · bah · ben · en fait (empty) · voilà · genre · du coup
These words add zero information. Every one is a skip trigger.
Cut them from keep_segments ruthlessly — they are never "natural pauses."

When the speaker says the same idea twice: keep only the strongest take.
When they restart a sentence ("the thing about… the thing is…"):
  cut to the cleaner restart.

EVERY LINE of `script_structure` must map back to a real timestamp
in the transcript. If you cannot find the exact words in the transcript,
you do NOT emit that line.

SCRIPT_RHYTHM = """\
SCRIPT RHYTHM — line-by-line, short sentences, TikTok/Shorts cadence

Hard returns between thoughts — every idea breathes alone.

Example output style (NOT words to use — just the rhythm):
  Tu rentres chez toi.
  Tu t'assieds sur ton lit.
  Et ce bonheur
  disparaît.

Open loops — the brain needs the payoff:
  State a fact. Cut. Open the question. Cut. DELAY the answer.
  Never close a loop before opening the next one.
  Example pattern:
    "Je me souviens d'être assis là à penser…"
    "et maintenant quoi ?"
    "Je t'explique dans une seconde."

NARRATIVE_STRUCTURE = """\
NARRATIVE STRUCTURE — every video maps onto these 8 beats

  1. HOOK (0–3s)
     Pattern interrupt. One sentence. No setup. No intro. No name.

     is dead. Hormozi rule: start with the conclusion, not the intro.
     → In `script_structure`, beat = "HOOK"

  2. PROBLÈME (3–8s)
     The relatable tension. What they believe or what they are doing.
     Make them feel the pain of the current situation.
     → beat = "PROBLÈME"

  3. CONSÉQUENCE (8–13s)
     What this costs them. Real. Personal. Visceral.
     Not statistics — lived experience. The price of staying wrong.
     → beat = "CONSÉQUENCE"

  4. OPEN LOOP (13–18s)
     Open a question. Do NOT answer it.
     "But the real reason is something nobody explains."
     "And what happens next changes everything."
     The viewer cannot leave because they need the answer.
     → beat = "OPEN_LOOP"

  5. HISTOIRE (18–50s)
     One real moment. Specific details. No lessons yet.
     Sanchez rule: make them see the scene like a movie.
     Re-hook here if long-form — new tension every 30s.
     → beat = "HISTOIRE"

  6. PRINCIPE (50–58s)
     One sentence. Universal. Timeless. Quotable.
     This is the line they screenshot. This is why they follow.
     Drop it with a 0.4s silence BEFORE it. Let it hit.
     → beat = "PRINCIPE"

  7. REFRAME (58–65s)
     Completely flip their mental model.
     What looked like a problem is actually the path.
     Short. No explanation. Trust the listener.
     → beat = "REFRAME"

  8. PAYOFF (last 3–8s)
     The idea they save the video for.
     Practical or deeply emotional. Sometimes both.
     Sanchez rule: give them something usable tomorrow morning.
     One sentence. Drop it. Silence.
     The discomfort of the ending is what makes them comment.

CUT_PHILOSOPHY = """\
CUT PHILOSOPHY — Hormozi / Sanchez surgical removal

Every single filler word is cut, instantly:
   um · uh · like · basically · so · you know · right · donc · euh · bah
   · en fait (when empty) · I mean · just · actually

Every pause above 0.25 seconds is cut EXCEPT:
   - the 0.5s silence BEFORE the PRINCIPLE line (intentional weight),
   - the 0.3s silence BEFORE the CLOSING line (let it land),
   - any pause the creator uses for deliberate emphasis (keep these).

Repetition kills retention. If the creator says the same idea twice,
keep only the strongest take. If they restart a sentence ("the thing
about… the thing is…") cut to the cleaner restart.

Every jump cut must feel intentional, not accidental. With every cut
SOMETHING changes — zoom level, energy, framing, or delivery intensity.

Hormozi rhythm pattern:
   Fast → Fast → Fast → SLOW → Fast → Fast → STOP.
   The SLOW is where the message lands.
   The STOP is where they save the video.
"""

PACING_RHYTHM = """\
PACING & RHYTHM ENGINE

PAUSE THRESHOLDS — precise rules:
  pause > 0.3s  → always jump-cut. No exceptions. Dead air kills retention.
  pause 0.2–0.3s → keep ONLY if it immediately precedes a PRINCIPE or
                   PAYOFF beat. Cut it everywhere else.
  pause < 0.2s  → keep; it's natural breathing, not dead air.

CUT FREQUENCY — non-negotiable targets:
  SHORT-FORM (under 60s) → 1 cut every 2–3 seconds maximum.
  LONG-FORM (over 60s)   → 1 cut every 4–6 seconds maximum.
  If a segment exceeds these limits, split it. Add a zoom punch-in or
  graphic to mark the split point so it doesn't feel arbitrary.
  Never let 7 seconds pass without SOMETHING changing — cut, zoom,
  graphic, or hyperframe.

SEGMENT SCORING — use this to prioritize what to keep vs. cut:
  High tension / conflict moment   → score 10  (always keep)
  Story / narrative beat           → score 7   (keep if fits pacing)
  Answer / payoff moment           → score 3   (keep, but compress)
  Filler / connective / repetition → score 1   (cut aggressively)
Score each transcript segment before building keep_segments. Drop score-1
segments entirely. Compress score-3 segments to their punchiest take.

RETENTION REORDERING — rearrange for maximum hook:
  Ideal structure: Hook → Story/Tension → Payoff → CTA
  If the speaker's strongest moment is buried mid-transcript, MOVE IT to
  0–3 seconds. Use keep_segments order (not transcript order) to achieve
  this reordering. Flag it in `summary` so the user knows.

CUT SPEED BY SECTION:
  HOOK / CONSÉQUENCE / OPEN_LOOP  → fast cuts (2–3s per segment)
  HISTOIRE                         → medium cuts (3–5s per segment)
  PRINCIPE / PAYOFF                → slow cuts (4–8s per segment,
                                      let the weight land)

SPEED RAMPS — flag moments for the renderer:
  speed_up moments: mundane connectives, quick examples, transitions
    between ideas that carry no emotional weight.
  slow_down moments: key takeaway delivery, emotional peak, final line.
  Express these as `speed_ramps` in your output — the renderer will
  apply a setpts ramp on those sub-segments.
  Rate range: 0.5 (half speed) to 2.0 (double speed).
  Default rate = 1.0 (no change).
"""

TRANSITIONS_ENGINE = """\
TRANSITIONS ENGINE

DEFAULT: hard cut. No dissolve, no fade between clips. Every cut is
surgical and intentional.

TOPIC CHANGE DETECTION:
  When you detect a new topic or section shift in the transcript,
  schedule a punch_in zoom in zoom_plan right at the cut point AND
  add a "whoosh" sfx_cue at that timestamp.
  Same topic continuing → hard cut only, no special zoom needed.

MOTION-BLUR FEELING:
  A punch_in (scale snap) at a cut point creates the motion-blur
  sensation perceptually — no extra filter needed. The snap from
  1.02 → 1.15 at cut time IS the motion blur.

AUDIO-LED CUTS:
  When a speaker delivers a sharp consonant, hard stop, or emphatic
  final word — that is the cut point. Align keep_segment edges to
  these audio cues, not to arbitrary time intervals.
"""

ZOOM_SYSTEM = """\
ZOOM SYSTEM — the tension engine. Three moves, master these three.

ABSOLUTE RULE: NO SHAKE. NO TREMBLE. EVER.
The renderer eases every drift with smoothstep — your job is to make
sure your zoom_plan windows DO NOT OVERLAP and that consecutive
windows share endpoint values (the `to` of window N == the `from` of
window N+1) so the curve is continuous. Anchor is locked to frame
center; you do not control x/y.

SLOW ZOOM IN  (kind: "drift")
  Speed: extremely slow, must be subconscious.
  Rate: +0.5% per second maximum (e.g. 100% → 103% over 6s).
  Use during: Hook, Consequence, Principle, Closing.

SLOW ZOOM OUT  (kind: "pull_out")
  Speed: slow and deliberate.
  Rate: -0.5% per second maximum (e.g. 108% → 102% over 12s).
  Use during: after peak tension, Story, Realization, Reframe.

PUNCH IN  (kind: "punch_in")
  Instant cut held for the whole window.
  Renderer DOES NOT interpolate — it locks at `to` for the whole
  [start, end] window. Make `start` and `end` close (≈0.05s) and
  schedule a slow zoom-in continuation right after.
  Jump: minimum +15% scale.
  Use on: the single most important word per section, supplied as
  `on_word`.
  Never twice within 10 seconds.
  Always followed by a slow drift continuing from the new scale.

Reference arc for short-form (60s):
   0–5s     100% → 103%   slow zoom in
   5–15s    103% → 108%   slow zoom in
  15–25s    108% → 102%   slow zoom OUT (breath after contrast)
  25–35s    102% → 112%   slow zoom in
  35.0–35.05s  PUNCH IN to 122%   (on principle word)
  35.05–45s    122% → 126% slow zoom in
  Final     PUNCH IN to 130% — hold — hard cut

For long-form, the same shapes but with lower amplitude:
  base 100%, drift to 105–110% max, punch-ins reserved for one per chapter.

KEN BURNS for B-roll and static moments:
  B-roll windows (from broll_suggestions) get a slow pan + scale effect
  automatically via the renderer. You do not need to add zoom_plan entries
  for b-roll timestamps — the renderer applies a 3–5s linear drift.
  Never schedule a punch_in inside a b-roll window.

PUNCH-IN AUDIO TRIGGER:
  When the speaker's delivery clearly spikes (a sharp emphatic word,
  a hard consonant, a loud "STOP" or "LISTEN") — place a punch_in at
  that exact timestamp AND add an "impact" sfx_cue. The visual snap
  + audio hit land simultaneously. One per 10s minimum gap.
"""

CAPTION_RULES = """\
CAPTION RULES — non-negotiable. The renderer enforces these mechanically.

Font: Poppins Bold. Always. No exceptions.

Color: Pure White #FFFFFF with a solid black outline (2–3px).
  This combination is readable on any background — dark, bright, or b-roll.
  No gradients. No shadows only. The outline IS the readability mechanism.

WORD-ON-SCREEN — every key word the speaker says must appear on screen
the moment they say it. This is the edutainment standard.
  - Every noun, verb, number, and concept word gets a caption.
  - Fill in `caption_emphasis_words` with ALL meaningful words (not every
    single word — filler words already cut do not need captions).
  - The viewer should be able to follow along with the captions alone.
  - Captions appear centered on screen, spanning ~90% of the screen width.

POSITION: always centered. Never bottom-only for emphasis captions.

SIZE — single consistent size, ~8% of video height. Bold and readable.
  The renderer applies this automatically.

ONE word per caption frame. Maximum. Always.
Words appear ONLY when they are spoken — exactly on the syllable.

No punctuation in captions. Ever. No commas, no periods, no quotes.

Zero captions during B-roll. Pause the caption track over those
windows (the renderer does this automatically from `broll_suggestions`).

Caption style: always "impact" — one-word card, black outline for
readability, centered on screen.
"""

HYPERFRAMES = """\
HYPERFRAMES — pattern interrupts every 7–10 seconds

Place hyperframes aggressively. One every 7–10 seconds minimum.
A hyperframe is a single full-screen visual for 2–4 frames (≈0.08–0.16s
at 30fps). Subliminal. The viewer feels it, can't explain why.
This is the edutainment secret weapon — it resets attention before it drifts.

Allowed kinds:
  - "word"   — a single bold word filling the screen (PUSH, NOW, WHY, STOP,
               FREE, WAIT, LISTEN, WRONG, TRUTH)
  - "number" — one number filling the screen (3, 47, $1M, 80%)
  - "color"  — a flat solid color flash (#FF7751 salmon by default)
  - "image"  — describe the image; renderer renders it as a colored card

Pick a `color` per hyperframe. Default to #FF7751 (salmon).
Use high-contrast colors — salmon, white, black — to maximise the interrupt.

Return as `hyperframes`: list of objects with `at`, `duration`,
`kind`, `content`, `color`.

Rules:
  - One hyperframe per 7–10s window. Place them aggressively.
  - Never inside a B-roll window.
  - Hyperframes during silence or right before a punch-in feel best.
  - Count your timeline — verify no 10s+ gap exists without a hyperframe,
    zoom punch-in, or graphic.

MOTION_GRAPHICS = """\
MOTION GRAPHICS — every graphic earns its existence

Decoration is the enemy of retention. If a graphic does not make the
message stronger, it does NOT appear in the output.

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
TIMING — appear AFTER the words are spoken, never before
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Set `at` to 0.5–1.5 s AFTER the relevant sentence or key word
STARTS being spoken — never at or before it.
The viewer must hear the idea first, then see the graphic that
reinforces it. A graphic that pops before the speaker says the word
feels like a spoiler and breaks the rhythm.

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
POSITIONING — never cover the subject's face
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
The user message will contain a "SUBJECT POSITION" block with the
exact y_pct safe zones detected by Claude Vision for THIS video.

  Landscape 1920 × 1080 → safe: x_pct ≤ 10 or x_pct ≥ 62.
For checklist and stat_circle the renderer anchors them to the
upper zone automatically; you do not need to set y for those.
Full-frame types (quote_card, split_screen, versus, typography_broll,
money_counter) render at x=0, y=0 and fill the frame — use sparingly
so they don't cover the speaker for too long.

text_overlay — the universal primitive
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Place arbitrary text anywhere on the frame, with the font, size,
colour, position, line-wrap, and slide direction you choose.

Schema:
  { at, duration, kind: "text_overlay",
    text: "Dev Team\\n+ Maintenance\\n= Drag",
    font: "Poppins Bold" | "Bebas Neue" | …      // any allowed font
    size: 15,                                     // % of frame short edge
    color: "#FFFFFF",                             // any hex
    align: "left" | "center" | "right",
    x_pct: 5, y_pct: 8,                          // % of frame WxH
    max_width_pct: 25,                            // soft-wrap at 25% frame width
    slide_in: "left" | "right" | "none" }

`size` is a PERCENTAGE of the frame's shorter dimension (1080 on both
short and long form). size: 15 → 162 px — readable but not overwhelming.
Use `\\n` to break lines manually; use `max_width_pct` for soft wrap.
Keep x_pct ≤ 10 or ≥ 62 and y_pct ≤ 12 or ≥ 72 to stay off the face.

        to: 1250000, currency: "$", positive: true }
      use: revenue, costs, big numbers the speaker is referencing.

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
TRIGGER WORDS → GRAPHIC RESPONSE
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
When the speaker mentions these, use this graphic type:

"percent / %" → stat_circle (count_up)
"number / amount / cost / price / $" → money_counter
"first / second / third / step" → timeline or checklist
"wrong / mistake / most people think" → split_screen (left_label: "WRONG") or checklist with red X items
"right / solution / instead" → split_screen (right_label: "RIGHT") or checklist with green items
"versus / vs / compare" → versus or split_screen
"God / faith / Bible / prayer / church" → quote_card with the spiritual line
"listen / remember / key insight" → typography_broll with the key word
Use checklist for lists of 3–5 items
Use lower_third for section titles and transitions
Use text_overlay for quick data points that reinforce what is being said

3–8 graphics in a 60s short, 10–18 in a 5–8 min long. Don't stack
two graphics in the same 4s window — let each breathe. Mix
text_overlay (light, frequent) with templates (heavier, rarer

VISUAL_STYLES = """\
VISUAL STYLES — three cinematic layouts for high-impact moments

Use `visual_style_moments` for moments where the raw talking-head frame

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
STYLE 1 — Giant Text on Person  (kind "giant_text" in motion_graphics)
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Huge white number or stat (e.g. "65%") + coloured subtitle below
(e.g. "FAIL IN 10 YEARS").
The person stays fully visible. Text is placed in the SAFE ZONE
detected by Vision — above or below the face, never on it.

Use as a `motion_graphics` entry (NOT `visual_style_moments`):
  { "at": <s>, "duration": 3.0, "kind": "giant_text",
    "number": "65%",
    "subtitle": "FAIL IN 10 YEARS",
    "subtitle_color": "#FF3B30" }

Trigger: any moment the speaker states a shocking statistic or percentage.
The number arrives 0.5–1s AFTER the speaker says it.

══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
STYLE 2 — Whiteboard + Vignette  (style: 2 in visual_style_moments)
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
White background. Text or concept on the LEFT side.
Person in a rounded vignette (bottom-right) with a blue glow border.
Black decorative bars on far left and right edges.

Use for: explaining a concept, showing 3 reasons, a framework, a system.

Schema:

STYLE 3 — Slide + Vignette  (style: 3 in visual_style_moments)
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
White background. Big bold TITLE on the left, bullets below.
Person in a rounded vignette (bottom-right) with blue glow border.
Same black side bars as Style 2.

Use for: principles, rules, step-by-step lists, key takeaways.

BROLL_RULES = """\
B-ROLL — maximum 2 clips, ever.

Less is more. B-roll breaks the speaker-to-viewer connection. Use it
only when the visual DRAMATICALLY reinforces the spoken idea — never
for variety or decoration.

Placement (must match the spoken context precisely):
  Clip 1 → during STORY/CONTRAST  (show the concrete scene or wrong way)
  Clip 2 → during PAYOFF          (make the key idea land visually)

Each b-roll suggestion's `at` is the EXACT START of the sentence whose
content the visual matches. Read the transcript word-by-word and pick
b-roll moments that align with the spoken concept — not random
intervals.

DURATION: minimum 2.5s, maximum 4.0s. Hard cuts in, hard cuts out.
The renderer will clamp anything outside that range.

No transitions. No fades. No dissolves. Captions are paused during
b-roll automatically.

If b-roll does not make the message stronger, it does not exist.
If you cannot find a sentence whose context matches a b-roll concept,
DO NOT EMIT THAT B-ROLL. Zero b-roll clips is acceptable — mismatched
b-roll destroys credibility faster than no b-roll.

SOUND_DESIGN = """\
SOUND DESIGN ENGINE

Schedule SFX cues as `sfx_cues` in your output. The renderer will
mix them into the audio track if the corresponding file exists in
backend/storage/sfx/. If the file is absent, the cue is silently skipped.

Available SFX types and when to use them:
  "whoosh"  — on any topic-change zoom transition or scene shift.
              Place 0.05s BEFORE the cut point so it leads the visual.
  "impact"  — simultaneously with every punch_in zoom, and on the
              single most emphatic word per PRINCIPE/PAYOFF beat.
  "riser"   — 0.5s before a new section starts (HISTOIRE, PRINCIPE,
              PAYOFF). Builds subconscious tension.
  "click"   — fires on each emphasis-word caption appearance.
              Keep sparse: only the top 3 emphasis words per video.

SILENCE rules (already in `silences` output field):
  0.3–0.5s complete silence before PRINCIPE and PAYOFF.
  The renderer ducks audio to 0 at those points.

MUSIC INTENSITY AUTOMATION — express via `music_energy` field:
  HOOK        → "high"    (upbeat, forward momentum)
  HISTOIRE    → "medium"  (calm, let story breathe)
  PRINCIPE    → "low"     (reduce to near zero, words hit harder)
  PAYOFF      → "medium"  (build back up)
  CLOSING     → "low"     (reduce to silence or near silence)

The renderer uses `music_energy` as metadata — actual music mixing
requires a background track loaded by the user.

AUDIO DUCKING (automatic in the renderer):
  Speech detected → music −12 dB over 0.2s fade-in
  Speech ends     → music returns over 0.3s fade-out
  The `silences` entries in your plan override this with full 0-level duck.
"""

RETENTION_MECHANICS = """\
HIGH-RETENTION MECHANICS — edutainment standard

HOOK FIRST — non-negotiable:
  Identify the single most shocking, counterintuitive, or emotionally
  charged moment in the entire transcript. If it's not in the first 3
  seconds, MOVE IT THERE. Use keep_segments reordering.
  The hook must create a question in the viewer's mind that the rest
  of the video answers. No setup. No intro. No "hey guys."

TENSION BEFORE PAYOFF:
  Never resolve tension early. The payoff must feel earned.
  Open a loop → delay the answer → open another loop → delay again →
  resolve both simultaneously at the end.
  The viewer who feels they're "almost there" will never skip.

PATTERN INTERRUPTS every 7–10 seconds:
  A viewer's attention resets every 7–10 seconds without stimulation.
  Force a change every 7–10s using ANY of:
    - zoom punch-in
    - hyperframe flash (2–4 frames)
    - motion graphic appearing
    - cut to new angle/clip
    - sfx hit (impact/whoosh)
  Track your output timeline. Verify no 10s+ gap exists without one.

SILENCE REMOVAL:
  Any pause over 0.3s is dead air. Cut it. No exceptions except for the
  deliberate 0.3–0.5s before PRINCIPE/PAYOFF beats.
  Viewers interpret silence as the video being over.

Re-hook every 30 seconds in long-form — a new tension or promise.

Open loop principle: never close a loop before opening the next one.

Silence as a weapon: 0.3s of placed silence > 5s of talking, when
positioned right before the most important line.

CONDITIONAL TRIGGER TABLE — use these rules when planning:
  pause > 0.3s detected           → jump cut, no exceptions
  speaker emphasis spike           → punch_in zoom + "impact" sfx_cue
  new topic in transcript          → punch_in at cut + "whoosh" sfx_cue
  key phrase (principle/payoff)    → bold caption + 0.3s silence before
  b-roll moment                    → broll_suggestion + Ken Burns by renderer
  no interrupt for 7–10s           → insert hyperframe or zoom punch-in
  emotional peak (story climax)    → slow cut pace + speed_ramp rate 0.7
  mundane transition               → speed_ramp rate 1.5–2.0 to compress
  section start (HISTOIRE etc.)    → "riser" sfx_cue 0.5s before

  - script_structure lines: verbatim transcript words only, never invented.
  - silences: only before PRINCIPE and PAYOFF, 0.3–0.5s max.
  - titres_ctr: 5 titles, each deliverable from the video content.
  - thumbnail_mot: ONE word, uppercase, maximum emotional charge.
  - One hyperframe per 7–10s window. Never inside b-roll.
  - visual_style_moments: 0–3 entries, duration 2.5–6s, never in first 3s,
    never overlapping each other or b-roll windows.
  - giant_text: use inside motion_graphics (NOT visual_style_moments).
  - sfx_cues: max 1 per 5s window; "whoosh" before topic-change cuts,
    "impact" with punch_in zooms, "riser" 0.5s before new sections,
    "click" on top-3 emphasis words only.
  - speed_ramps: rate 0.5–2.0; slow_down for PRINCIPE/PAYOFF delivery,
    speed_up for mundane connectives. Never ramp mid-sentence.
  - music_energy: one entry per named beat section.
  - Be ruthless. Tension > comfort. Specific > generic.
  - Output ONLY JSON. No prose around it.

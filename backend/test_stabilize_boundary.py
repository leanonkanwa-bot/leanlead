"""
Local tests for the stabilization loop and snap helper.

Covers:
  - Adjacent-word pre-check (fix 1): boundary at contact point → no snap
  - Contact-point snap (fix 1): snap to we/ws instead of we+gap when adjacent
  - Gap-preserving fallback (fix 2): planned source gap > 300ms → restore s_j
  - Contiguous fallback (original): 0-gap adjacent words → e=s=contact_point
  - Existing snap and clamp cases (unchanged)

Run with:  python backend/test_stabilize_boundary.py
